      At VidaKit, we strive to provide survival kits to all communities in need.
      <br><br>
      Many American households are living paycheck to paycheck. According to an analysis
      of U.S. government data by the United Way Alice Project, 50 million households canâ€™t afford
      basic living expenses. That's why for every survival kit that is purchased from our
      website, we donate one kit to a family living in a high risk area that cannot afford to purchase one on their own.
       <br><br>
      VidaKit provides an easy way for people to stay
      prepared for the most common natural disasters. From our website,
      customers can purchase a survival kit tailored to different types of natural disasters.
      Not only do we provide you with a kit, but we also keep you informed and ready should
      something happen.
