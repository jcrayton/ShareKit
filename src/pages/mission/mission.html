      At VidaKit we provide a risk management opportunity for Americans to equip themselves and each other for natural disasters. VidaKit provides an easy way for people to stay prepared for the most common natural disasters to come their way. From our website, customers can purchase a survival kit tailored to different types of natural disasters. If you live in San Francisco, you can buy kits for earthquakes and wildfires, or if you live in Houston, you can buy kits for hurricanes and flooding.
      <br><br>
      Not only do we provide you with a survival kit, but VidaKit helps you stay prepared. Through the standard supplies in the kit, customers are kept informed about disaster preparedness. We also offer an opt in auto-replenishment service that would have replacement supplies sent to your home as components of the Kit expire. With our replacement supplies, we will also send information about safely disposing of medications as well as opportunities in your area to recycle or reuse expired products.

      However, we recognize that many households are living paycheck to paycheck. In fact, according to an analysis of U.S. government data by the United Way Alice Project, 50 million American households can’t even afford basic living expenses. This is why we don’t expect every american family to purchase a survival kit. A large aspect of what is unique about VidaKit is that for every Survival Kit that is purchased from our website, we donate one kit to a family living in a high risk area that cannot afford to purchase one on their own.
