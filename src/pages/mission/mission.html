      At VidaKit, our aim is to provide opportunities for Americans to equip themselves
      and each other for natural disasters. VidaKit provides an easy way for people to stay
      prepared for the most common natural disasters to come their way. From our website,
      customers can purchase a survival kit tailored to different types of natural disasters.
      For example, people living in San Francisco can buy a kit for earthquakes, and people living
      in Houston can buy a kit for severe flooding.
      <br><br>
      Not only do we provide you with a survival kit, but we also keep you informed and always ready should
      something happen. Every kit comes with detailed information about what materials are inside and how to use them.
      We also offer an opt-in auto-replenishment service that would have replacement supplies sent to your
      home as components of the kit expire. We will also send information about safely disposing of medications
      as well as opportunities in your area to recycle expired products.
      <br><br>
      However, we recognize that many households are living paycheck to paycheck. In fact, according to an analysis
      of U.S. government data by the United Way Alice Project, 50 million American households can’t even afford
       basic living expenses. This is why we don’t expect every american family to purchase a survival kit. 
       A large aspect of what is unique about VidaKit is that for every Survival Kit that is purchased from our
       website, we donate one kit to a family living in a high risk area that cannot afford to purchase one on their own.
